## Project Description: Twitter Clone with T3, PlanetScale, and Upstash

In this project, I am creating a Twitter clone, a simplified version of the popular social media platform, using a stack of modern web development technologies. The main goal is to replicate key features of Twitter while implementing a robust and scalable backend.

### Key Technologies

1. **Next.js**: I use Next.js as the foundation for my web application. Next.js provides server-side rendering, routing, and a great developer experience for building React applications.

2. **NextAuth.js**: For authentication, I rely on NextAuth.js, which simplifies user authentication with various providers like email/password, social media, and more. This ensures secure and seamless login functionality.

3. **Prisma**: Prisma is my choice for database management. It offers a type-safe and efficient way to interact with the database, enabling me to work with my data models using TypeScript.

4. **PlanetScale**: To handle the database infrastructure, I use PlanetScale, a database platform that provides scalability and reliability. This ensures that my Twitter clone can handle a growing user base and data load.

5. **TRPC**: TRPC (The TypeScript RPC) is employed for building APIs in a type-safe manner. It simplifies API development and ensures that my frontend and backend communication is robust.

6. **Upstash**: For caching and real-time updates, Upstash is integrated into my project. It allows me to implement features like live notifications, trending topics, and improved performance through caching.

### Project Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can sign up for an account and log in securely using email/password or social media accounts.
- **Posting Tweets**: Users can create and share tweets with text and media attachments.
- **Like and Comment**: Users can like and comment on tweets, fostering interaction and engagement.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile page displaying their tweets, followers, and following.
- **Following and Followers**: Users can follow and unfollow other users, and they can see a list of their followers and those they are following.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and accessible on various devices.
